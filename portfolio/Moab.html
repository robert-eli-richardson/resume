                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">In the first semester of BYU's MPA program, every student receives assignments to a team and an identical class schedule. Faculty work together to ensure that a large chunk of the curriculum is group work. As anyone with a University education can imagine, this first semester can sour quickly without proper planning. To enable groups to succeed,  Faculty assign each team a mentor and require all students to sign a pledge that they will not work for pay. Team members must be available during the day on campus to work with their groups.</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Some students are underwhelmed with the course load and have more to offer. Thankfully, there is an approved nonprofit organization, <a target="_blank" title="Grantwell Home Page" href="https://www.grantwell.org/">Grantwell</a>, with whom students may volunteer.</p>
                            <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">The Project</h2>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">I applied to Grantwell after learning of an opportunity to work with Moab city on its RAP Tax implementation. After being selected for the team, I was excited to put my previous local government experience to work; however, the project did not progress linearly. To make our product worthy of Moab's time, we would need to go beyond the information we found from internet research and tap into the network of local government professionals to hear best practices and advice.</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Using my network, ICMA conferences, and UCMA conferences, I interviewed local government professionals from Spanish Fork, Santaquin, and Blanding. As a team, we wove their insights and resources into our recommendations. </p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Although I was craving independent work opportunities, it was beneficial to be a part of a second team pressured by deadlines and expectations. Some sections of the report would not have been possible if not for teammates with specific skills/knowledge. I was also suprised at how easily we expanded our team to include seasoned government professionals. The willingness of these local leaders to turn over every insight and trade secret they had was inspirational to me. </p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">We presented our 24-page report to the Grantwell advisory board; They described our work as the finest completed that semester. We then presented to the finance director of Moab. During the following semester, another team helped with the implementation and presented to the Moab city council. </p>

                                        If you're going to lead a space frontier, it has to be government; it'll never be private enterprise. Because the space frontier is dangerous, and it's expensive, and it has unquantified risks.

                                        When I look at the universe and all the ways the universe wants to kill us, I find it hard to reconcile that with statements of beneficence.
